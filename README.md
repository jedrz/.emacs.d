# My emacs configuration #

Configuration migrated to [.doom.d](https://github.com/jedrz/.doom.d)

This repo contains my emacs configuration. A lot of things were stolen from:
* [EmacsWiki](http://emacswiki.org)
* [WikEmacs](http://wikemacs.org)
* [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
* [Emacs Starter Kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit)
* [magnars's .emacs.d](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d)
* [purcell's emacs.d](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d)
* [lunaryorn's latex configuration](https://github.com/lunaryorn/stante-pede)
